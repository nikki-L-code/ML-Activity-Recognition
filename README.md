Activity Recognition from Accelerometer
Activity recognition is of importance as it shares a linear relationship between energy to exert force. This enables the use of movement acceleration to reflect energy expenditure in individuals performing different activities. In this paper, the efforts to recognise different activities from a tri-axial accelerometer is evaluated and reported. Evaluation of activity recognition for this study is done through two classification models: decision tree and K-nearest neighbours, where these models are evaluated and compared. Comparison of both models are based on their performance and rate of accuracy, where the model with the higher rate of accuracy and thus better performance, is recommended as the model most suitable to recognise activities from accelerometer data.Â
